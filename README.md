# [An e-commerce landing page.](https://tshirtify.netlify.app/)

## Technologies used:

-   jQuery
-   Bootstrap
-   CSS
-   Html

## Features:

-   Responsive design made by Bootstrap framework.
-   Contact form.
-   Newsletter signup.

### note:

To optimise the landing page for search engines (SEO) I built the project as a static page using html and JS(jQuery) , compared to client side frameworks such as React , this way itâ€™s more likely to appear to the costumers in the search engine with unpaid priority ranking.
